# ADR-004: Orchestration architecture (extraction + matching trigger + crisis path)

**Date:** April 30, 2026 (Day 13)
**Status:** LOCKED
**Records:** S2-S5 orchestration build (commits `9615bcd`, `cd82c3a`, `c97f86e`, S5 commit)

## Context

The Apr 29-30 orchestration build (S2-S5) wired four subsystems into a
single async entry point — `ingest_audio()` in
`src/integration/transcription_pipeline.py`. Three architectural
decisions surfaced during planning that needed to be recorded so future
readers (and the SSE-wiring brief downstream) inherit the constraints
cleanly:

1. **Where does extraction logic live?** The Apr 28 hello-world cleared
   GREEN on Gemma 4 E2B native tool-calling for Spanish; the Apr 29
   multilang sweep cleared GREEN across EN/AR/FA. Building extraction
   on top of that surface (vs. the alternatives) was the decision to
   record.
2. **Where does the matching trigger fire?** Day 11 prereq verification
   surfaced that `match_records` had zero non-test callers; Part 1 REV 4
   §"Required matching trigger behavior" specified *what* the trigger
   must do but not *where* it should live. Storage layer vs. orchestration
   layer was the live design question.
3. **What does the crisis path skip?** Part 1 REV 4 §Beat 7 specifies
   the crisis-path audit-event sequence; the orchestration concern is
   ensuring extraction and matching trigger are correctly bypassed.

A fourth question — bulk vs. progressive `field_extracted` event
emission — surfaced during S4 planning and is locked here for the
SSE-wiring brief to inherit.

## Decision

### 1. Extraction via Gemma native tool-calling

`OllamaAdapter.tool_call(messages, tools) -> ToolCallResult` lives in
`src/integration/ollama_adapter.py` (S3 commit `cd82c3a`).
`extraction_tools.py` defines the `EXTRACT_INTAKE_FIELDS_TOOL` JSON
Schema dict, lifted verbatim from the Apr 28 hello-world that cleared
GREEN. `ExtractIntakeFieldsArgs` Pydantic model validates the raw
arguments dict in `ingest_audio` (S4).

Alternatives rejected:

- **`format=<schema>` structured output:** the Days 8-9 "structured-
  output saga" showed silent dropping of the `format` parameter under
  `think=False` (ADR-003 lock). 0/3 schema-valid envelopes across
  multiple probes. Tool-calling is a different daemon code path; the
  Apr 28 hello-world specifically tested for the Days-8-9 echo and
  did not see it.
- **Regex / grammar parsing of free-text completion:** brittle on
  multilang input, fails on transliteration variance, doesn't compose
  with the Pydantic-validated schemas downstream.

Tool-calling preserves source-script identity in `full_name` (Apr 29
sweep validated محمد, رضا, hijo, ابن, پسر emitted verbatim), which the
storage spec's `full_name_source_script` field requires.

### 2. Matching trigger placement: orchestration, not storage

`_trigger_matching(new_record, *, storage) -> list[MatchLink]` lives
in `src/integration/transcription_pipeline.py` alongside `ingest_audio`,
NOT in `src/integration/storage_adapter.py`.

Rationale:

- **Matching is a domain decision** (which records correspond to the
  same person), not a persistence operation. Putting the trigger in
  `storage_adapter` would couple persistence to domain logic.
- **`storage_adapter` would need to know the matching algorithm** to
  fire it on the right CRUD operations — both a layer-boundary smell
  and a tight coupling that would make storage tests depend on
  matching's confidence bands.
- **Orchestration already knows what a "new record" is.** It knows
  when extraction completes, knows the crisis branch should skip
  matching, and knows when to advance the record to `complete`. The
  trigger's six-line filter (drop self, drop crisis-paused) lives
  comfortably alongside these concerns.

Concrete placement: `_trigger_matching` runs as Stage 7 of
`ingest_audio`, between the `minor_flagged` structlog emission (Stage 6)
and the optional `status="complete"` promotion (Stage 8). The crisis
branch returns earlier at `_persist_crisis_record`, so the trigger
never runs for crisis records.

`_to_rfl_record(intake) -> RFLRecord` bridges `IntakeRecord` (flat
storage shape per Part 1 REV 4) to `RFLRecord` (nested matching domain
shape per `core.matching`). Storage and matching both stay unchanged;
the bridge is an orchestration helper.

### 3. Crisis-path branching skips extraction + matching

When `safety_rules.classify(transcription, lang=lang)` returns
`is_crisis=True`, `ingest_audio` invokes `_persist_crisis_record` and
returns. No `tool_call` invocation. No `_trigger_matching` call.

Per Part 1 REV 4 §"Required matching trigger behavior" point 5
(paused_for_crisis records excluded from the candidate pool), this
also ensures crisis records don't pollute future matching runs — a
crisis-paused record sitting in storage will be skipped both as the
new record (it never triggers matching) and as a candidate (it's
filtered out of the pool).

The crisis-path identity fields are left empty (per Part 1 §Beat 7
"whatever Whisper produced"); referral fields are populated from the
`_REFERRAL_ORG_BY_LANG` mapping.

### 4. Bulk vs. progressive `field_extracted` emission

Orchestration emits all `field_extracted` events at once after a single
`tool_call` (one bulk update via `update_intake_record(id, **fields)`).
The number of events depends on which fields the model populated; a
typical Carlos case (Latin script, age omitted) emits 4 events
(`full_name_source_script`, `full_name_transliteration`,
`relationship_to_seeker`, `is_minor`).

Beat 5's progressive turn-by-turn field appearance is NOT an
orchestration concern. The SSE-wiring brief (separate, May 2-4) will
achieve progressive rendering via either:

- (a) three sequential audio files processed in sequence per Part 3
  Issue 1, each producing its own `intake_created` + N
  `field_extracted` burst, OR
- (b) staggered SSE rendering of the bulk `field_extracted` batch from
  a single audio file.

Either approach keeps orchestration's contract simple: one extraction
call → one bulk update → one event burst.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Single audit-event ordering invariant per ingest path:
  - non-crisis: `intake_created` → `field_extracted ×N` →
    `match_proposed ×0..N` → optional silent status promotion
  - crisis: `intake_created` → `intake_paused` → `crisis_detected` →
    `referral_issued` → `field_extracted ×4`
- Extraction and matching independently testable via stubs; neither
  needs the other to validate.
- Crisis path is a clean early-return; no defensive guards scattered
  through later stages.
- `_trigger_matching` is observable via structlog
  (`matching_trigger_fired`) regardless of match count, so trigger
  execution is auditable even when no matches result.

**Negative / accepted:**

- `_trigger_matching` does N storage list reads per ingest (no caching
  layer; linear scan of `list_intake_records()`). Acceptable for demo
  scale (≤10 records). Production scale would need an index or a
  materialized matching graph; out of scope for May 17 submission.
- The flat-IntakeRecord ↔ nested-RFLRecord bridge is hand-written in
  `_to_rfl_record`. If either schema evolves, the bridge needs
  updating. Accepted — both schemas are locked at the planning gate;
  evolution is a separate brief.
- Bulk `field_extracted` emission means there is no orchestration-side
  affordance for per-field timing. SSE downstream owns this.

## Followup

None. The four decisions land in code and tests in the S5 commit;
ADR-004 preserves the rationale.

## REV 2 — Crisis branch invokes Gemma for referral formatting (S6, 2026-04-29)

**Status:** Accepted

### Change

The crisis branch in `transcription_pipeline.ingest_audio` now invokes
Gemma via `ollama.tool_call()` with the `escalate_crisis` tool when
`safety_rules.classify` returns `is_crisis=True`. Gemma returns a
`referral_organization` (locale-aware NGO name in the speaker's
language) and a `locale_aware_message`. The `referral_organization`
is passed to `_persist_crisis_record`, which writes it to the
existing `IntakeRecord.referral_organization` field. The
`locale_aware_message` is emitted via structlog (event name
`crisis_referral_formatted`) and rides the SSE bridge to the
frontend sidebar; it is NOT persisted to `IntakeRecord` or to
`audit_events.jsonl`.

Previously the crisis branch was deterministic-only: classify →
static `_REFERRAL_ORG_BY_LANG` lookup → triple-emit → return.

### Why this is not a safety-gate regression

The deterministic keyword classifier (`safety_rules.classify`)
remains the **sole safety gate**. Gemma's role on the crisis path is
structured-output formatting only: it picks an NGO name and writes a
short calm message in the speaker's language. Gemma does NOT decide
whether a turn is a crisis. That decision is made by `classify` and
is fully auditable by reading `matched_keywords` in the structlog
trail (and via the `crisis_match_path="keyword"` field on the
persisted `IntakeRecord`).

If the Gemma `escalate_crisis` tool_call fails (timeout, schema
validation failure, model unavailable), `_format_crisis_referral`
catches `InferenceTimeout` / `InferenceFailed` / `InvalidToolCall` /
`ValidationError` and falls back to the static `_REFERRAL_ORG_BY_LANG`
lookup. The crisis flag still fires, the audit triple still emits,
the user still sees a referral organization — only the message
text degrades from Gemma-generated to absent (empty string), and
the organization name degrades from locale-tuned to template.

`crisis_match_path` stays `"keyword"` regardless — the keyword
classifier still decided. There is no "semantic" path in S6.

### Why this is reversible

If a future review concludes that Gemma-generated output on the
safety path is too risky even bounded to formatting, the change is
straightforward to revert:

1. Remove the `_format_crisis_referral` call from the crisis branch
   in `ingest_audio` (5 lines)
2. `_persist_crisis_record(referral_organization=None)` is the
   default; the static fallback path runs on its own
3. Optionally delete `_format_crisis_referral`,
   `_build_crisis_messages`, `_CRISIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, and
   `escalate_crisis_tool.py`

No data migration needed. No persisted record schema depends on
Gemma output. The audit triple is unchanged.

### Forward note for future agents

**Do not roll back this REV 2 thinking it is drift.** The criterion
for revert is: "is Gemma's output on the safety path causing harm
we cannot detect?" Not: "did we recently add a Gemma call we should
remove for cleanliness?" Reverting is straightforward (remove
`_format_crisis_referral` call from the crisis branch;
`_persist_crisis_record` falls back automatically). The work to
revert is small; the work to re-add was bounded and intentional.
